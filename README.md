## FAQ

> Does this work with steam games?

No. You don't own the games you bought on Steam and you're not allowed to copy them to other computers. I recommend buying DRM-free games from [GOG](https://gog.com) or [Itch.io](https://itch.io).

## Building

Prerequisites:

- Rust (nightly)
- [Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/)
